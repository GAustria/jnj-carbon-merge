## About IBM Carbon and this repository.

[IBM Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) is an open-source design system created by the team at IBM. 

This repository consists of wrappers for React implementation of IBM Carbon. The wrappers are higher order React.js components and are used to integrate IBM Carbon with UXPin Merge technology.
Using wrappers (higher order components) is not necessary to integrate React.js components with UXPin, but in case of IBM Carbon, it made the integration significantly easier.


## About UXPin Merge

Merge is a revolutionary technology that lets users import (and keep in sync) coded React.js components from GIT repositories to UXPin editor. 
The imported components are 100% identical to components used by developers during the development process. 
It means that components are going to look and, function (interactions, data) identical to the real product experienced by the users. 

[UXPin](http://uxpin.com) is a leading codeâ€“based design platform.
